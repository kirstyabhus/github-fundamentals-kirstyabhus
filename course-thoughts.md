#### ✔️ Questions I had before the course, which have now been answered:
- What is Git? & _How_ does it actually work?
- Git commands [(my cheatsheet)](my-git-commands-cheatsheet.md)
- git fetch vs git pull
- Git vs GitHub
- How to get files from a local to a remote repository using git on the command line

#### 💡 I also learned:
- Typical Git Workflow
- Branching 🌳
- Git best practices (specifically to use branches and make small frequent commits)
